# Sprint Retrospective Template

The retrospective is where a Scrum team improves how it works.

The purpose is not to review the product.  
The purpose is to improve the process.

If a team skips retrospectives, delivery quality slowly declines.

## Preparation

Before the meeting the Scrum Master prepares:

Sprint goal  
Completed stories  
Unfinished stories  
Blockers encountered  
Any incidents during the sprint

Keep the data factual. Avoid opinions.

## Meeting Structure

### 1. What went well

Identify practices that helped delivery.

Examples:

Good collaboration  
Clear requirements  
Useful communication  
Effective planning

### 2. What did not go well

Discuss problems honestly but without blame.

Examples:

Blocked work  
Unclear stories  
Late changes  
Over commitment

The focus is the process, not individuals.

### 3. What should we change next sprint

Select one or two specific improvements.

Do not create a long list. Teams rarely implement many actions.

## Action Rules

Each action must:

Have an owner  
Be realistic  
Be reviewed in the next retrospective

Example:

Improve story readiness before sprint planning  
Owner: Product Owner

## Closing the Retrospective

Summarise the agreed improvements and record them in the next sprint backlog.

If no actions are tracked, the retrospective becomes a discussion instead of a tool for improvement.
