# Case Study: Improving Team Delivery

## Situation

A team was struggling to complete work within a sprint. Tasks regularly carried over and stakeholders lost confidence in delivery dates.

Work entered the sprint without clear requirements and priorities frequently changed during the sprint.

## Actions Taken

Introduced a structured backlog review before sprint planning.

Defined acceptance criteria for each item before it could enter a sprint.

Agreed a sprint goal to focus the team on a single outcome.

Encouraged the team to limit work in progress and complete items before starting new ones.

Ran short retrospectives focused on identifying one improvement per sprint.

## Result

The team began completing the majority of planned work within each sprint.

Stakeholders gained visibility of progress.

Sprint reviews became demonstrations of finished work rather than status updates.

The team reported reduced stress and clearer expectations.

## Key Learning

Predictable delivery depends more on clarity and focus than on working longer hours. Clear backlog items and realistic sprint scope had the biggest impact.
