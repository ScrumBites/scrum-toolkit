# Scrum Toolkit

This repository contains practical materials for teams that want to run Scrum properly without turning it into ceremony theatre.

The focus is simple. Clear structure, predictable delivery and visible progress.

Many organisations say they use Agile but still operate in chaos. These resources are designed to help teams move from constant urgency to controlled, repeatable delivery.

## What This Toolkit Includes

Sprint planning structure  
Backlog creation guide  
User story writing guidance  
Daily stand up format  
Sprint review structure  
Retrospective templates  
Delivery tracking examples

## Who This Is For

Project teams moving to Scrum  
New Scrum Masters  
Product Owners without formal training  
Managers trying to understand how work actually flows

## Goal

The goal is not to “do Agile”.  
The goal is to make work visible, prioritised and deliverable.

More templates and examples will be added.
