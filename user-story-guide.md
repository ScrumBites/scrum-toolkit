# Writing User Stories

Poor user stories are one of the main reasons Scrum teams struggle to deliver.  
If work is unclear, the team cannot estimate properly, cannot plan confidently and cannot finish reliably.

A user story is not a task.  
It describes a piece of value from the user’s perspective.

## The Basic Structure

As a [type of user]  
I want [capability]  
So that [benefit]

Example:

As a customer  
I want to reset my password  
So that I can access my account without contacting support

The final part matters. It explains why the work is valuable.

## What Makes a Good Story

A good user story should be:

Clear  
Small enough to complete in a sprint  
Understandable by the whole team  
Testable

If a developer and a tester interpret the story differently, the story is not ready.

## Acceptance Criteria

Every story must include acceptance criteria.  
These define when the work is complete.

Example acceptance criteria:

User can request a password reset  
User receives reset email  
User can create a new password  
User can log in successfully

Without acceptance criteria, the team never knows when to stop working.

## Definition of Done

The team should agree a shared definition of done before the sprint begins.

Typical definition of done:

Work implemented  
Reviewed  
Tested  
Working in the environment  
No critical defects

If the definition of done is unclear, unfinished work accumulates across sprints.

## Common Mistakes

Writing technical tasks instead of user outcomes  
Stories too large to finish in one sprint  
Missing acceptance criteria  
Changing scope during the sprint

## Why This Matters

Clear user stories create predictable delivery.  
Unclear stories create delays, rework and frustration.

Good Scrum depends more on clear backlog items than on ceremonies.
